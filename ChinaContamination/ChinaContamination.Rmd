## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


## ## ## ##  Environment  Settings  ## ## ## ##

# Packages required for this proyect
pkgs <-c("tidyverse",   "caret","kernlab",  "randomForest","knitr")

# If a package is missing it will added in the missing packages list
missing_pkgs <-pkgs[!(pkgs %in% installed.packages())]

# The packages in the list will be installed
if (length(missing_pkgs)) {
  install.packages(missing_pkgs, repos = "http://cran.rstudio.com")
}
#Load the required libraries
library(caret)
library(tidyverse)
library(kernlab)
library(randomForest)
library(knitr)

## ## ## ##  Data Stage  ## ## ## ##

#Download the data
if (!file.exists("ANAD_Normalized.csv")){
  download.file("https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/xm232yxf7t/1/files/e535362e-ce98-4729-8c7a-f32fec55cc30/ANAD_Normalized.csv?dl=1", "ANAD_Normalized.csv")
  }


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
